# Dynamic_Stack
This is a fully dynamic implementation of a stack using pointers and dynamic memory. 

This is a practical lab from my Advanced C++ module. It is a fully dynamic implementation of a stack using pointers and dynamic memory. This allows for operations such as finding an element by value, finding an element by index, copying the stack object, copy constructor and more.
